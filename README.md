# Voyage

Voyage is a grinding game meant to be played on spare time.

## Gameplay

### Fishing
To fish, press the `f` key. When the cooldown is done, all of your men will fish.

### Crew Management
- **Hiring**: Go to the shop to hire more crew members
- **Combat**: 
  - You need more men than the enemy to win fights
  - If you have fewer men, you'll lose the fight and your save data
  - If you have more men, you'll lose some men but get fainted men
  - Fainted men can be healed by sleeping next to a shop
  - **Warning**: If you bring 10x or more men than the enemy has, your crew will get careless and you'll lose 90% of them to friendly fire!

### Shop System
The shop allows you to:
- Sell your caught fish
- Buy upgrades and items
- Heal fainted crew members
- *(Planned)* Store prized fish in an inventory system
